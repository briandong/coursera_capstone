# Capstone Project - The Battle of Neighborhoods

## Introduction
This report is for Capstone Project in Coursera [Applied Data Science Capstone](https://www.coursera.org/learn/applied-data-science-capstone).

## Business Problem
Assume that I want to open a successful Chinese restaurant in a U.S. city.

To achieve this goal, first of all I need to choose a city in U.S. Since it is a Chinese restaurant, a multi-cultural metropolis sounds promising. So I would like to select San Francisco.

The second step is to choose an ideal location of the restaurant in the city. I can leverage the Foursquare location data and machine learning skills to learn which are the most popular areas for Chinese restaurants. 

## Who would be interested in this project?
Someone who also has interest in opening a successful restaurant in a U.S. city.
